# üå≥ **Project Yggdrasil: The Tree of Knowledge AI Assistant**

**Project Yggdrasil** is an advanced multi-agent AI system designed to act as a personal knowledge repository and management assistant. Inspired by the Norse Tree of Life, Yggdrasil enables users to integrate, organize, and visualize their knowledge, notes, and files into a structured "Tree of Knowledge." Using AI-powered multi-agent orchestration, the system empowers users to streamline knowledge curation and optimize personal or professional knowledge management workflows.

## üé° **Overview**

**Project Yggdrasil** leverages **LangGraph** for orchestrating intelligent conversations between specialized agents, creating a dynamic knowledge ecosystem. Users can consolidate their notes, files, and data into the system, which uses AI to analyze, connect, and visualize information, enabling effective curation and streamlined access.

### **Core Features**
- **Knowledge Integration**: Seamlessly upload and organize notes, files, and documents.
- **Tree of Knowledge Visualization**: Automatically create a visual representation of your knowledge base to explore connections.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**:
  - **Supervisor Agent**: Routes user requests to specialized agents.
  - **Researcher Agent**: Handles data gathering and analysis.
  - **Writer Agent**: Manages content creation and editing.
  - **Coder Agent**: Provides programming solutions and explanations.
- **Web Search Integration**: Use external resources for additional context and knowledge.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track interactions and processes in real-time with **LangSmith**.
- **Fallback Intelligence**: Seamlessly switch between Groq LLM and OpenAI APIs for enhanced reliability.
